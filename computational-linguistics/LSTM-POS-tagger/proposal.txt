LSTM with word embeddings for POS tagging: 
This will be a sophisticated upgrade of the assignment#2, where we had implemented a HMM-Viterbi based POS tagger 
which happens to be the most classical way to implement a POS tagger. With LSTM architecture, the performance has 
been proven to increase significantly. Although this is totally not a new idea, but with this project I aim to 
compare different word embedding that uses sub-word information or that don't, comparison with traditional methods 
in regards of training performance/accuracy. The idea is loosely based on the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.06168.pdf
